# Canonical Signatures

This repo contains a list of signatures which are considered "canonical" for the purposes of the [signature database](https://openchain.xyz/signatures).

What makes a signature canonical is subjective, but here are some reasons why a signature might be considered canonical:
- the signature comes from a finalized standard
- the signature comes from a heavily used protocol

Here are some reasons why a signature might not be considered canonical:
- the signature is from a protocol which is not heavily used
- the signature was brute-forced
